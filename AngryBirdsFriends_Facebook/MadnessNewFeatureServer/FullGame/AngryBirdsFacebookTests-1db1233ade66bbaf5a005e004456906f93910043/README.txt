What is this you ask? Why it's deobfuscated scripts for the game!

How did this happen:

Rovio has an asset in their asset map for the game in their html file for the game, being this file which is a fully deobfuscated build of the game, likely for QA testers. You can't run it currently but the majority of the code is readable. Study away!

Enjoy!
