What is this you ask? Why it's deobfuscated scripts as well as binary data filenames for the game!

How did this happen:

Rovio left a _secure_map.xml file on the two discs of the game, having all of the original deobfuscated strings in the form of an XML map table from the software used to obfuscate the game (for whatever reason) being SecureSWF version 3.6. With manual replacement of the many strings, the majority of the code is readable.

Why is it WIP:

There's still some codebases not yet deobfuscated, most of the game/Rovio specific code was deobfuscated but may have incorrect values. Please read the TOOLDEOB folder for a more complete deobfuscation.

Enjoy!
